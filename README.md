# FCUL_ALS_Disease_Progression

## Requirements

Using [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) for dependency management, saving the
required packages and their specific versions so as to facilitate
reproducibility. As such, it's recommendable to use ```poetry install``` in the
directory before proceeding.

Also, if on macOS and PyTorch isn't working, it might be needed to install
libomp through [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```brew install libomp```
